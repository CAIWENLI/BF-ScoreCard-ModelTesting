# BF-ScoreCard-ModelTesting

During the course of this project, we aim to test out all the machine learning methods we have on our existing score card based on demographic and transaction information. In the past, we used a logistic regression model. In this project, we tested out more than ten models on the same dataset and compared them using cross-validation and ROC analyses.
